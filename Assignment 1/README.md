|                     | DCF                                                                               | Relative Pricing                                                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Value of assets** | Discount the future cash flow                                                     | Standardized price multiply with multiples                        |
|      **Inputs**     | Expected future cash flows, discount rate, (growth rate), total life of the asset | Standardized price (e.g. EPS), multiples (e.g. P/E, EBITDA, etc.) |
|    **Advantages**   | Based on the asset's fundamentals                                                 | Better captures current market moods and perceptions              |
|                     | Multistage model                                                                  | Requires less explicit information and assumptions                |
|                     |                                                                                   | Timely and relativity                                             |
|  **Disadvantages**  | Relies more on assumptions                                                        | Multiples choosing can be subjective sometimes                    |
|                     | Some inputs and information are noisy (and difficult to estimate)                 | Scenarios that lack of comparables                                |
|                     | Difficult to forecast cash flows in cyclical business                             | Market sentiment may lead to pricing bias                         |
